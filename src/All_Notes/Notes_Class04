*** Note Shortcut- If your code look messy with lot of spaces and uneven brackets
                   use Shortcut for making it readable or organizable

Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like- addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    division
    Compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are 3 main types of Operators:
    1) Arithmetic Operators
    2) Relational Operators
    3) Logical Operators

 1) Arithmetic Operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations.
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    / Division
    % Modulus, Remainder

 2) Relational Operators:
    Relational Operators are used to Compare two quantities or entities,
    eg: if something is bigger than other thing or
        if two numbers are same or not,
        if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
    == To check if two variables contain same value or not if same we get TRUE ortherwise we get False
    != To check if two variables are NOT of the same value, we get TRUE if they are not same & False if they are same.
    >  To check if one variable is Greater than another or not, if it is Greater we will get TRUE & if not then False.
    <  To check if one variable is Less than the another or not, if it Less we will get TRUE & if not then False.
    >= To check if one variable is Greater than another or not, if it is Greater we will get TRUE & if not then False.
    <= To check if one variable is Greater or Equal than another,if it is Greater or Equal we will get TRUE
       & if not then False.
    >= To check if one variable is Less or Equal than another, if it is Less or Equal we will get TRUE
       & if not then False.

    Conditional Constructs:
    -----------------------
 1) If Else
    A conditional code where a piece of code that execute based on a condition, if condition is true that Java execute
    the code otherwise it skip that code.

    How to write Ifelse condition:
    if(condition1){
    @ Expected output if the above given condition1 is True
    @ You can give another 'If' condition
        if(condition2){
        Expected output if the above given condition2 is True
        }
    }

**** If you test the same variable for multiple conditions use---> if else if
**** If you have multiple variable and multiple conditions are dependent on each other use---> Nested if

Type casting widening and narrowing---- implicit or explicit


Logical Operators: Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine the multiple boolean values.
There are 3 logical operators !(not)    ||(or)     &&(and)
