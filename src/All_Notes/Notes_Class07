While Loop:
    They help us repeat code.

Why should we use while loops:
when you don't know how many times you will repeat the code
    Because manually copying and pasting is very bad and it's not scalable.
    They also help us reduce the number of lines of code that we have to type

Syntax WhileLoop:
    while (condition){
    code that we want to repeat
    }

for loop
when you know in advance how many times you will repeat the code
